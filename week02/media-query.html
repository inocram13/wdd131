            <h2> 1 Nephi 3:8</h2>
            <p>7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
